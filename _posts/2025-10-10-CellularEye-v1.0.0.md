## Introduction
{: .box-success}
Welcome to the official homepage of the CellularEye dataset. CellularEye is a pioneering large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for environmental perception research. It uniquely features IQ data collected from commercial communication equipment (BBU, AAU), alongside synchronized high-resolution optical, infrared, and weather data. Our goal is to bridge the gap between communication and sensing, empowering researchers to explore the future of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC).

![RV Map Example](https://github.com/ffxu1024/CellularEye/tree/master/assets/img/rv-map.gif)  ## Key Features

* **Commercial Cellular Signals**: Real-world IQ data from operational cellular network equipment, not simulated or lab-grade signals.
* **Rich Multi-modal Data**: Tightly synchronized data streams including IQ, visible spectrum video, infrared video, and detailed weather metrics.
* **Diverse Scenarios**: Covers a wide range of environmental conditions, including different times of day, weather patterns, and target activities.
* **Continuous Evolution**: CellularEye is a living dataset. We are committed to continuously updating it with more data and richer annotations.

We provide a Python-based development kit to help you easily read and visualize the data.
